# Digit Recognition Competition on Kaggle

![Kaggle Logo](https://www.kaggle.com/static/images/site-logo.png)

## Description
This repository contains the code and resources for my submission to the "Digit Recognition" competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on images provided in the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this competition consists of a large number of images of handwritten digits, with corresponding labels indicating the actual digit represented in each image. The training dataset contains labeled images to build and train our model, while the test dataset contains images for which we need to predict the digit.

You can find the dataset on the Kaggle competition page: [Digit Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognition/data)

## Approach
In this competition, I used various machine learning and deep learning techniques to build and train my digit recognition model. The steps involved in my approach include:
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Training and validation of the models.
- Prediction and submission to Kaggle.

## Results
The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy on the validation set and submission results on the test set. The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation set, and the Kaggle submission score was Y.

## Instructions
To replicate the results or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page and place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., "data/").
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook "digit_recognition.ipynb" to train and test the models.
4. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each step.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, seaborn
